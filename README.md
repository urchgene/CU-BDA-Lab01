###Bayesian Data Analysis

###Introduction:

I am Uche Godfrey Okeke, a PhD student at the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University. I am interested and working on developing genomic prediction models for genetic evaluation of plant genotypes given multi-trait and multi-environment trial data.  


In the plant breeding field, breeders usually carry out multi-environment trials or experiments where they record and evaluate the performance of plant genotypes at different locations in same or different agro-ecological zones. Performance for instance grain yeild in the case of a cereal crop can be evaluated by recording different parameters on a plant genotype during its growth and developmental stage and also at maturity and production stages. These parameter measurements or records are termed **traits**. The use of trait records for different genotypes to evaluate their performance and deduce genotype superiority at any given environment is termed **genetic evaluation**.

####Genetic evaluation:
The standard for genetic evaluation in plant and animal breeding is the use of the Linear Mixed Model (LMM) Analysis or BLUP machinery (Henderson, 1950). BLUPs of genotypes obtained from the LMM analysis while assuming that genotypes come from a normal distribution with a zero mean and variance-covariance matrix accounting for genetic relatedness of genotypes (via a pedigree or genomic information) are termed *breeding values* which are invaluable information for selection decisions in plant breeding.

####Data for genetic evaluation:
For genetic evaluation, we need trait records from different genotypes. Examples of traits are grain yeild, plant height, absense/presence of disease etc. Trait records can be continuous or discrete in nature. We also need pedigree records showing parents and offspring of a genotype or recently a genomic marker matrix showing markers and alleles inherited by different genotypes been evaluated.
